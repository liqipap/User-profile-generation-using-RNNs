# User-profile-generation-using-RNNs
## Main Idea
We mainly focus on deep learning methods of user profile generation based on users’ text data, as well as identification of implicit
organizations (e.g., robots, water army, etc.) based on user profiles.
Currently we are introducing methods in *Knowledge Representation Learning (KRL)* into *Social Media Computing (SMP)*.

**P.S.** We collected text data of ~10GB from Sina Weibo.
