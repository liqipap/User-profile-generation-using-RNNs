# User-profile-generation-using-RNNs
## Main Idea
Inspired by the conceptions from *NMT* and *word2vec*, a method which combines the results from seq2seq model and one-to-many model is proposed to automatically generate user profiles.  

**P.S.** Data is collected from Sina weibo.

Uh.. Here is an incomplete and more simple implementation...  

More details about the real loss function, nn structures and optimizers will (maybe) be available when results of *kernel k-means* analysis are good enough ;(
